   	<h1>A bit more about me</h1>
    <p>Hello there. I'm Aurenia, a UI/UX Designer and a part time illustrator. Indonesian born and raised, but currently based in Melbourne, Australia.</p>
    <p>Since I was very young I've always been interested in learning and trying new things. Other than illustration, I was fairly good at Math and taught myself HTML/CSS back in highschool. At some point I realised that my passion lies in learning and being creative. In late 2012, I moved to Australia to pursue my BA of Communication Design degree at RMIT University.
    <p>
    Though I've always had a great appreciation in beautiful interfaces (coming from a traditional graphic design background), I want my design to be impactful. With an ever evolving field like UX, I'm able to touch on wide variety of subjects and fulfill my passion in learning and creating. 
    </p>
    <p>Outside of design, I spend time travelling with friends, making cheesy birthday cards, listening to podcasts, and taking photos.</p>
    <p>Have a flick at my portfolio and feel free to contact me if you'd like to have a chat.</p><br>
